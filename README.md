# Software Developer
## The basics
### What is a Software Developer?
- Software developers are the masterminds behind computer programs. They use their programming and design knowledge to build solutions for problems using software.
Typically, they build software after receving specifications from a client. They will then develop, test, and deploy that software based on the client's requests. Software exists everywhere, and software developers are the ones designing it. 
### Duties and Responsibilites
- Troubleshoot and debug existing software
- Produce clean, efficient code based on client specifications
- Gather and evaluate user feedback
- Design and improve software algorithms
- Collaborate with other team members to design new algorithms
### What Education is Required?
To become a software developer, you typically need a bachelor's degree in software engineering, computer engineering, computer science, or a related field. Employers also require candidates to have experience in the field. 
### What Skills are Needed?
#### Technical Skills
- Knowledge of programming languages
- Math knowledge
- Data structures and algorithms 
- Database knowledge
- Source control
- Testing procedures
#### Non-technical Skills
- Problem-solving skills
- Critical thinking
- Teamwork/Collaboration skills
- Organizational and time management skills
- Attention to detail
### Salary Range for a Software Developer
The average salary for a software developer in Canada is approximately $80,000. On the lower end, one can expect a salary of $57,000, and on the higher end, one can expect a salary of $110,000.

### Experiential Learning
There are many ways that could attain valuable experience that is not through traditional school.

- Internships: **Professional Experience Year Co-op (PEY Co-op)**

  - PEY-Co-op is a work integrated learning program that is offered by the University of Toronto. It is available to undergraduate engineering students and allows students to gain paid work experience. Students apply their skills in legitimate engineering positions, while building up their professional networks. 

- Research Projects: Participate in research projects related to computer engineering
- Start a new project: Starting your own project related to computer engineering can help you to gain valuable skills, as well as learn to problem solve and critically think.
