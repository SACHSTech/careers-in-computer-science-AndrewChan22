### What is a Software Developer?
- Software developers are the masterminds behind computer programs. They use their programming and design knowledge to build solutions for problems using software.
Typically, they build software after receving specifications from a client. They will then develop, test, and deploy that software based on the client's requests. Software exists everywhere, and software developers are the ones designing it. 
### Duties and Responsibilites
- Troubleshoot and debug existing software
- Produce clean, efficient code based on client specifications
- Gather and evaluate user feedback
- Design and improve software algorithms
- Collaborate with other team members to design new algorithms
### What Education is Required?
To become a software developer, you typically need a bachelor's degree in software engineering, computer engineering, computer science, or a related field. Employers also require candidates to have experience in the field.
